### 3. Fix Submenu Navigation Issues

**Locations to check and fix:**

#### A. Data Exploration Menu (`core/pipeline.py` ~480)
```python
def explore_data_menu(self):
    while True:
        # ✅ Check: Does it show options every loop iteration?
```

#### B. Model Management Menu (`core/pipeline.py` ~580) 
```python
def model_management_menu(self):
    while True:
        # ✅ Check: Does it show options every loop iteration?
```

#### C. Results Menu (`core/pipeline.py` ~680)
```python
def view_results_menu(self):
    while True:
        # ✅ Check: Does it show options every loop iteration?
```

#### D. Help Menu (`core/pipeline.py` ~780)
```python
def help_menu(self):
    while True:
        # ✅ Check: Does it show options every loop iteration?
```

#### E. Database Menu (`core/pipeline.py` ~880)
```python
def view_database_menu(self):
    while True:
        # ✅ Check: Does it show options every loop iteration?
```

### 4. Remove Redundant Version Information Display

**Current Issue:**
Version information and feature updates are displayed multiple times throughout the application:
- Once in main menu selection
- Again when starting interactive mode
- Feature lists shown repeatedly

**Examples of Redundant Display:**
```
ENHANCED MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE v2.1
🔥 NEW in v2.1: Manual Preprocessing Controls! 🔥
• Configure scaling, missing values, outliers manually...

# Then immediately after:
🚀 Starting Enhanced ML Pipeline v2.1...
🚀 Enhanced Machine Learning Pipeline v2.1
🔥 New Features in v2.0:
• 📚 Comprehensive parameter documentation...
```

**Fix Required:**
- Remove redundant version displays from workflow
- Create dedicated "About/Information" menu option
- Show version info only when explicitly requested

**Recommended Solution:**
Add new menu option: `11. ℹ️  About & Version Information`

This would show:
- Current version and release date
- New features in current version
- System information
- Dependency status
- Credits and acknowledgments

### 5. Improve ID Column Selection Logic

**Current Issue:**
The system detects multiple ID columns but only offers a binary choice (include all or exclude all). Users need granular control to exclude specific ID columns while keeping others.

**Example Problem:**
```
🔑 Detected ID columns: ['StudentID', 'StudyTimeWeekly']
Exclude these columns from modeling? [y/n] (y): n
✅ ID columns will be included in modeling
```

**Issue:** User may want to exclude 'StudentID' (true ID) but keep 'StudyTimeWeekly' (actual feature).

**Fix Required:**
- Allow individual selection of columns to exclude
- Improve ID detection logic to avoid false positives
- Provide interactive column-by-column choice

**Recommended Solution:**
```
🔑 Detected potential ID columns: ['StudentID', 'StudyTimeWeekly']

Configure each column:
1. StudentID: [E]xclude / [I]nclude / [A]uto-detect (E): 
2. StudyTimeWeekly: [E]xclude / [I]nclude / [A]uto-detect (A): 

Or choose: [A]ll exclude / [N]one exclude / [I]ndividual selection (I):
```

### 6. Enhance ID Column Detection Logic

**Current Issue:**
The ID detection algorithm may incorrectly classify feature columns as ID columns.

**Improvements Needed:**
- Better heuristics for ID column detection
- Consider data types and value patterns
- Check correlation with target variable
- Allow user override of auto-detection

**Implementation:**
- Add statistical analysis for ID detection
- Consider semantic naming patterns
- Provide confidence scores for ID detection
- Allow manual column type specification

### 7. **MAJOR UPGRADE** - Data Exploration Module
